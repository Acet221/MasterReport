    "This function is used in case a movement has been made, and both angle (P2200) and encoder (P2243) are prompted before/after. We are interested wether the numbers also change in a manner similiar Bresenham algorithm, following the principle \"less difference is best\", or if there are cases where the angle/encoder could have been few units more/less. The function will predict the goal's encoder value and angle, so we can compare it with real data. However, the interpretation needs to be done manually.\n",
    "In short, it answers the question \"If I want to go from this angle to that angle, what change in encoder should I expect?\"\n",

    "Note: do not confuse step variable with motor steps. The former is simply the difference in encoder unit. "
